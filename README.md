# Voice Controlled Humanoid Robot with Speech Emotion Recognition
Voice Controlled Humanoid Robot is a mobile robot whose movement can be controlled by the user, giving specific voice-controlled commands. The voice command is received by the microphone of an android phone and processed by using the Google Voice API. The voice signals are then converted into the text and the app generates a variable against the text, in the form of command this variable is sent to Arduino Node MCU which analyzes the given commands and takes the appropriate actions. The Bluetooth module is used to connect the VCHR app with the VCHR system. A camera is also used for video live streaming in the android app and through the SONAR Sensors, the robot can detect any obstacle within its range and generate an alarm as a result. There are a total of 20 actions that are Forward, Back, Turn Left, Turn Right, Take Left, Take Right, Punch, Stand Up, Bow, Say Hello, Dance, Thank you, One Leg Balance, Warm-Up, Shake Hand, Driving Dance, Kick, See Left and See Right. In addition to these features, the VCHR system is also capable of speech emotion detection whenever given the speech input by the external mic provided. The data from the temperature sensor in the VCHR system is sent to the IoT cloud provider ThingSpeak to analyze and visualize the sensor data at different time intervals.
